The MISA tool will allow you to analyze mixed samples of multiple species that are hard to physically separate before sequencing,
 especially if there are no reference genomes or marker genes available. Input a genome skim from a mixture of two species into the MISA tool, 
 and it will output two placements on the reference phylogeny- one per contributing genome.
